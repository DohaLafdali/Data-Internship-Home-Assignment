as they are developed from end to end you will collaborate closely with microarchitects to gain an intimate lowlevel understanding of new hardware features as they are developed you will leverage this knowledge to develop and maintain software systems to functionally model and verify these features including targeted directed tests and complex random test benches written primarily using modern c and systemc your experience using the systems you build to detect and diagnose bugs will be critical toward our effort to build fully functional products you will also document and communicate feature specs to the software team to enable usage of the features you verify giving you a view of the full stack ideal candidates will have a strong background in software development and systemslevel

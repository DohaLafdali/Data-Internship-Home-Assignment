the development of our computer vision algorithms that would be used to power our mobility services reporting to the director of machine learning you will be responsible for the development deployment and ongoing optimization of the models that would be at the core of our platform the models you build will need to detect objects track its direction of motion and more and do all that in nearreal time this is a challenging opportunity because the models you build will need to be optimized for different conditions like indoors and outdoors lighting weather and field of view if you have a background in sensors and computer vision and are interested in mobility autonomous vehicles computer vision or machine learning this is the ideal opportunity for youltbrgtltbrgtwhen you join

    "description": "are you interested in ai and machine learning technology especially involving speech and language as one of microsofts most exciting ai initiatives speech recognition sr is driving the accuracy and robustness of natural user interfaces with natural spoken language and their deep integration to user facing produceservice from microsoft st party or rd party application the speech group develops speech recognition features in enterprise entertainment and desktop and mobile products and particularly in the voice platform that powers microsoft conversational transcription services search and assistant experience on desktop and mobile computing devices bing voice search microsoft office dictation skype speech to speech translation hololens and xbox voice search and voice commandltbrgtltbrgtthe speech group brings together talents in the areas of signal processing speech recognition statistical modeling and deep learning to develop and deliver robust natural and scalable speech recognition across a rich set of scenarios and languages as a science team in the speech group our modeling team pioneered the industrialized deep learning speech recognition technologies and contributed key innovations to the speech community now we are making some key bets on endtoend architecture for speech recognition which could be the next big wave we work on all kinds of endtoend speech technologies in both backend and frontend targeting on the most challenging problems by inventing new algorithms to that end we welcome scientists who are passionate at innovating the stateoftheart speech recognition technologies which impact millions of usersltbrgtltbrgtour group at its core values individual creativity and passion and is a place where we expect every scientist to continually grow both technically and personally we value people who can bring a diverse perspective to our product and where a scientist will not just develop ml models but will have a real meaningful impact on the direction of the product and which features to build we are building a team where diversity of thought and background is valued as strongly as technical skills and where everyone is encouraged to come up with new ideas to make our customers lives better you will find great rampampd opportunities on real data sets provided by one of the worlds largest

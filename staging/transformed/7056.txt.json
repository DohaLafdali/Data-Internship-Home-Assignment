normal administrative work required from a people manager sre managers need to know how different disciplines can come together on an sre team oftentimes sre teams will act somewhat independently from other engineering teams and need to work with some level of autonomy however its important that site reliability engineering managers are also wellconnected with the broader it engineering and business teams staying uptodate on feature development and how it could affect the systems overall reliabilityltpgtltpgtltbrgtltpgtltpgtltstronggt settingampnbspltstronggtslos slas and slisltpgtltpgtservicelevel objectives servicelevel agreements and servicelevel indicators are essential to sre teams the site reliability engineering manager will define what it means for the system to be available and dictate the availability slo internal metrics of the system then the sre manager needs to provide an sla to business teams and the rest of engineering to show how much availability they can promise to customers then the team can start to track slis to evaluate whether the system is meeting the required percentage of availabilityltpgtltpgtltbrgtltpgtltpgtltstronggt project planning and prioritizationltstronggtltpgtltpgtsite reliability engineering managers are also in charge of project planning and task prioritization its important that sre managers sit in on quarterly planning and sprint planning with the greater engineering and it teams then the site reliability engineering manager can assess the key objectives for the next few sprints and pass those priorities to the rest of theampnbspltstronggtsre teamltstronggt this way the sre team can begin building features and functions that proactively monitor the health of new features communicate observations to the

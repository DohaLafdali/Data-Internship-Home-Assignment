    "description": "at toyota research institute tri were working to build a future where everyone has the freedom to move engage and explore with a focus on reducing vehicle collisions injuries and fatalities join us in our mission to improve the quality of human life through advances in artificial intelligence automated driving robotics and materials science were dedicated to building a world of mobility for all where everyone regardless of age or ability can live in harmony with technology to enjoy a better life through innovations in ai well helpltbrgtltulgtltligt develop vehicles incapable of causing a crash regardless of the actions of the driverltligtltligt develop technology for vehicles and robots to help people enjoy new levels of independence access and mobilityltligtltligt bring advanced mobility technology to market fasterltligtltligt discover new materials that will make batteries and hydrogen fuel cells smaller lighter less expensive and more powerfulltligtltligt develop humancentered ai systems to augment not replace human decision making to increase the quality of decisions eg mitigate cognitive biases andor to facilitate faster innovation cyclesltbrgtltligtltulgtour work is guided by a dedication to safety in both what we research and how we perform our research our goal is to benefit society as a subsidiary of toyota tri is fueled by a diverse and inclusive community of people who carry invaluable leadership experience and ideas from industryleading companies over half of our technical team carries phd degrees were continually searching for the worlds best talent people who are ready to define the new world of mobility with usltbrgtltbrgtwe strive to build a company that helps our people thrive achieve worklife balance and bring their best selves to work at tri you will have the opportunity to enjoy the best of both worlds a fun environment with forwardthinking people who enjoy solving tough problems and the financial backing to successfully achieve our goals come work with tri if youre interested in transforming mobility through designing technology for safer cars enabling the elderly to age in place or designing alternative fuel sources start your impossible with usltbrgtltbrgtour machine learning ml team is looking for worldclass research scientists and engineers to turn toyotas data advantage into an ai advantage as the car maker in the world with million cars on the road today we can learn from massive amounts of data to realize safe automated driving on a global scale our teams mission is to use all the data to identify and solve open research problems on the critical path to automated driving we are working on some of the hardest challenges in the area of perception eg scene understanding d vision tracking prediction eg handling uncertainty predicting human behavior trajectory forecasting planning eg understanding and reacting to human intent multiagent modeling and general machine learning eg selfsupervised learning imitation learning active learning multitask learning domain adaptation robustness to the heavy tail of edge cases efficient deep learning large scale distributed training we invent new deep learning algorithms that can leverage massive amounts of data labeled or not experimentally showing stateoftheart performance both in internal benchmarks and public ones publishing at top machine learning and computer vision conferences and collaborating with our university partners we work closely with other teams at tri to transfer and ship our most

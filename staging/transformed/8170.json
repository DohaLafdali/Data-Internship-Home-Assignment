visualization tools the big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once without digging up multiple sources this works best when you can query

enable this in a userfriendly experience without leaving your browserltligtltligta customizable computation platform biologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts we want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic theyll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to benchlingltligtltligta new

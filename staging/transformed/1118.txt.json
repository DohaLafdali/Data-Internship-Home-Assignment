traditional aerospace companies we sell information not hardware we operate our sensors costeffectively at continental scale to produce novel data streams about pressing global problemsltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtfirst on our listampnbspspotting hardtomonitor emissions of methane a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change since starting continuous survey operations in kairos has removed methane emissions equal to over million tonnes of coe through our work to put that in perspective thats equivalent to over million cars being removed from the roads for a year or shutting down about seventeen mw coalfired power plantsltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtwe call that a good startltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtas a team we love science and engineering we love getting our hands dirty with hardware and software and we love seeing our work make a difference in the real worldltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtweve created a diverse collaborative supportive and fun
